## Running the app locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+ and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krelltunez/lastGLANCE.git
cd lastGLANCE
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. It hot-reloads on save.

Other useful commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | Production build to `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |

## Running tests

lastGLANCE does not have a test suite yet. Before submitting a PR, please run the linter to catch obvious issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```

If you're adding non-trivial logic (cadence calculations, sync/merge behaviour, encryption helpers), consider whether a test would make the logic easier to trust and maintain. The project uses Vite and TypeScript, so [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) would be a natural fit if a test suite is added in the future.

If you're looking for a specific feature, searching for a UI string or function name is faster than browsing linearly. The hooks in `src/hooks/` are named by concern (e.g. `useChores`, `useDB`, `useIntentsPoller`) and are a good starting point when tracing a feature end-to-end.

## Making a pull request

1. **Fork the repo** and create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-fix-or-feature
   ```

2. **Keep changes focused.** One logical change per PR makes review much easier. If you find an unrelated bug while working, open a separate issue or PR for it.

3. **Check your work**: run `npm run lint` and make sure the app builds without type errors (`npm run build`). If your change touches sync or intents behaviour, verify it manually against a WebDAV server if you can.

4. **Write a clear PR description.** Explain *what* changed and *why*, not just what the code does. If it fixes a bug, link the issue.

5. **Don't sweat perfection.** If you're unsure about something, open the PR as a draft and ask. We'd rather see a rough PR than no PR.

### Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style. The project uses React with TypeScript and Tailwind for styling.
- Avoid `any` and type assertions unless you have a genuine reason. Prefer narrowing types over silencing the compiler.
- Changes to `src/db/schema.ts` affect the local Dexie database. Treat schema migrations carefully and test that existing data survives an upgrade.
- Changes to `src/sync/` or `src/intents/` affect interoperability with the `@glance-apps/sync` and `@glance-apps/intents` packages. Check the [intents protocol spec](docs/dayglance-intent-protocol.md) before changing intent shape, as dayGLANCE consumes these intents.
- Avoid adding dependencies unless necessary.
- No em dashes in user-facing copy (UI strings, docs, READMEs). Commit messages and PR descriptions are fine.

## Reporting security issues

Please do **not** file public issues for security vulnerabilities. Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/krelltunez/lastGLANCE/security/advisories/new) instead, which sends the report directly to maintainers without exposing it publicly. This applies to anything that could compromise user data: sync credential leaks, encryption flaws, XSS, etc.

For non-sensitive bugs, use the public issue tracker as described below.

---

## Reporting bugs

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/krelltunez/lastGLANCE/issues) and include:

- **What you expected** to happen
- **What actually happened** (error message, screenshot, or screen recording if relevant)
- **Steps to reproduce**: the more specific, the better
- **Environment:** browser and OS version
