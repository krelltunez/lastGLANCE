 * Direct Access sync (docs/direct-access.md (and dayGLANCE's docs/direct-access-sync.md), Phase 5): a path relative to

 * The web layer names files by a path relative to the folder (the household
 * roster at GLANCE/users/glance-users.json; event files under GLANCE/events/).
 * A path that would escape the folder is refused HERE, in the shell, never
 * left to the renderer: `..` anywhere, an absolute path, an empty name. The
 * desktop store does the same with path.resolve plus a prefix check
 * (electron/directAccessStore.ts, resolveInside). Pure, so every rule is
 * unit-tested on the JVM; DirectAccessRepository walks the result over
 * DocumentFile.
