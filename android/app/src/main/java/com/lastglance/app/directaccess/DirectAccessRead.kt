/**
 * Direct Access sync (docs/direct-access.md): how one read of the
 * snapshot in the user's folder is classified.
 *
 * The folder is kept in step by a third-party app (Syncthing, FolderSync,
 * Autosync, a Nextcloud client), and the web layer runs the same cycle dayGLANCE runs
 * for its folder. That cycle reads one classification on every platform, and
 * this object produces it:
 *
 *   absent       the file is not there: the web layer may seed it.
 *   downloading  the file is there but cannot be trusted yet: a zero-length
 *                placeholder (a tool part-way through replacing it, or a
 *                provider that materialises cloud-only files empty), or a read
 *                that failed in a way worth retrying. NEVER reported as
 *                absent, because absent means "seed over it".
 *   error        the folder itself cannot be used: the SAF grant was revoked,
 *                the tree is gone, or the provider refuses to open the file.
 *   text         the file's content.
 *
 * Pure over the [Source] seam so every branch is unit-testable on the JVM;
 * DirectAccessRepository binds it to DocumentFile, for the snapshot and for
 * any file named by a path (Phase 5: the household roster), which only
 * changes the name in the messages.
