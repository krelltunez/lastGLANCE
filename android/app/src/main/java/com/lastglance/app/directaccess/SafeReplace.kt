/**
 * Crash-safe file replacement for SAF writes (ported from dayGLANCE): TEMP, DELETE, RENAME.
 *
 * SAF has no atomic replace — openOutputStream(uri, "wt") truncates the LIVE
 * document in place, so a crash, process kill, or power loss mid-write leaves
 * the note truncated at whatever the buffer had flushed (this path has
 * produced zero-byte notes before). renameDocument cannot rename over an
 * existing name, so a true swap is impossible; the chosen scheme is:
 *
 *     1. write the FULL new content to a hidden temp in the same directory
 *     2. delete the original
 *     3. rename the temp to the original name
 *
 * preferred over backup-then-write because its crash window leaves TWO files
 * rather than NONE: every interruption leaves the content recoverable on
 * disk, where backup-then-write's window can still lose the content outright.
 *
 * CRASH WINDOWS AND THE RECOVERY RULE (deterministic, no timestamps):
 *   • crash during step 1  → temp (possibly PARTIAL) + original intact
 *   • crash before step 2  → temp (complete)         + original intact
 *   • crash between 2 and 3 → temp (complete)        + NO original
 * The first two are indistinguishable from each other (a partial temp cannot
 * be told from a complete one) but share a resolution: the write never
 * reached its commit point, the app was never told "success", so the ORIGINAL
 * is the truth — discard the temp. The third is unambiguous: the delete is
 * only ever issued AFTER the temp was fully written and closed, so a temp
 * with no original is COMPLETE by construction — restore it. For this
 * inference to hold, a brand-new file (no original) must never use the temp
 * dance: there is no content to protect, and a direct write keeps
 * "temp without original" meaning exactly one thing.
 *
 * "Stale" needs no age heuristic: plugin writes are serialized (one Capacitor call at a
 * time from the single JS thread), so any temp
 * encountered at resolution time is by construction the residue of a crashed
 * write, never a write in progress.
 *
 * TEMP NAMING: `.<fileName>.lgtmp` — dot-prefixed so Obsidian's indexer,
 * Obsidian Sync, and this repository's own listings (which all skip hidden
 * files) never see it; same directory as the target because SAF rename only
 * works within a directory (and it keeps the temp on the same volume).
 *
 * Pure logic over the [Dir] seam so every crash window is unit-testable on
 * the JVM; DirectAccessRepository binds it to DocumentFile.
